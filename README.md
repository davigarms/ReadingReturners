## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/ 'Next.js') project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

**First, run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Database

MongoDB and Mongoose are used to store and model application data. A MongoDB URI should be defined in a `.env` file, according to the example provided.

## Styling

[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/ 'Styled Components') is utilised for convenient CSS-in-JS styling, along with design tokens generated by [Figmagic](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/figmagic 'Figmagic') and [Amazon Styles Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/ 'Styles Dictionary').

Figmagic fetches a document with predefined tokens directly from Figma and generates JSON files from their data, while Styles Dictionary exports their values in CSS and JS formats, to be applied consistently across the project.

A Figmagic Figma template can be found at:

https://www.figma.com/community/file/821094451476848226/Figmagic-%E2%80%94-Design-System-for-Tokens.

You will also need a `Figma API key` and the `URL id` of that document. More information can be accessed in the [Figmagic documentation](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/figmagic 'Figmagic documentation').

**To fetch Figma tokens and update the JSON files, run:**

```bash
npm run fetch-figma
# or
yarn fetch-figma
```

Tokens can also be generated directly from the JSON files using Styles Dictionary. They are stored in `figmagic/dictionary` folder, and can be edited manually without the Figma API.

**To generate the JS module from the JSON files, run:**

```bash
npm run build-dictionary
# or
yarn build-dictionary
```

**You can also run Figmagic and Styles Dictionary in a single command using:**

```bash
npm run build-figma
# or
yarn build-figma
```

## Deployment

[Serverless Next.js Component](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js 'Serverless Next.js Component') is used for deployment in AWS using S3, Lamba@Edge and CloudFront, for static pages, APIs and fast content delivery.

The configuration is defined in the `serverless.yml` file, following the example provided.

You should also use this file to add and access environment variables at build time.

**To deploy this project, run:**

```bash
  npm run deploy
  # or
  yarn deploy
```
